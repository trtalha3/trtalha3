### About Me

I’m Mohammad Tanjim Rahman Talha, a passionate creator from Bangladesh who lives at the crossroads of technology and creativity. Whether I’m programming robots to sense their environment or designing visuals that spark emotion, I’m driven by the thrill of bringing ideas to life.

With solid skills in <code>C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</code>, I build embedded systems, IoT devices, and frontend applications — all with the goal of solving real-world challenges.

For me, coding is more than logic — it’s a way to make machines think, move, and connect. And design isn’t just decoration — it’s storytelling through every color and shape.

Simply put: I build with precision and create with purpose.
