### About Me

I’m Mohammad Tanjim Rahman Talha, an inquisitive developer and designer from Bangladesh with a passion for blending science and creativity. I thrive at the intersection of logic and imagination—building robots that interact with the world and crafting visuals that tell compelling stories.

With hands-on expertise in **C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I focus on developing embedded systems, IoT devices, and front-end applications that solve real problems.

My work isn’t just about writing code or making graphics—it’s about creating things that move, sense, and communicate in ways that inspire and engage.

In essence, I bring precision to programming and soul to design.

I once programmed a robot to blink its LED faster than the human eye can catch — a small reminder that with creativity and technical skill, even the simplest projects can spark amazement.
