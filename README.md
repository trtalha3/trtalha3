### 👨‍🔬 About Me

I’m **Mohammad Tanjim Rahman Talha**, a curious mind from Bangladesh fueled by a blend of science, creativity, and logic. Whether it’s programming a robot to sense the world or designing visuals that captivate, I’m passionate about building meaningful experiences.

I code fluently in **C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, diving deep into robotics, embedded systems, and the Internet of Things.

💡 My work goes beyond code — I create **things that move, think, and inspire.**

🎨 By night, I transform ideas into compelling digital art and brand identities that tell authentic stories.

In short, I’m the person who codes with precision and designs with heart.
