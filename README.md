# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanjim Talha

### 💻 I code. I build robots. I design stuff. That’s just me.

I’m a student from Bangladesh who’s always making something —  
sometimes it’s a website, sometimes a robot, sometimes a poster.  
From coding in C/C++ to designing in Canva or Illustrator, I enjoy learning and building things that actually work (or at least try to 😅).

## 🔧 What I Actually Know

- 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for building responsive websites  
- 👨‍🔧 C & C++ – for solving problems and writing robotics code  
- 🤖 Arduino, Sensors, Motors – for real-world robot projects  
- 🎨 Canva, Adobe Illustrator – for poster, banner & logo design
