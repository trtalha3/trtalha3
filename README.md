### 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm **Mohammad Tanjim Rahman Talha**, a curious mind from Bangladesh blending science, creativity, and logic to shape cool stuff — from real robots to stunning designs. I code in **C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript** and explore the frontier of robotics and embedded systems.

💡 I don't just write code — I build **things that move, sense, and think.**

🎨 I also breathe life into visuals through **graphic design**, creating unique digital art and branding that tells a story.

🧠 In short, I’m the guy who codes a robot during the day and designs your brand identity at night.
